# MLCCI code

The experiment is divided into two parts, one is MCLLI approach and the other is Fuzzy Weighted KNN approach which is baseline.

**Run MCLLI approach experimental code**

1.Execute the main function of featureExtract.py, obtain the results of four feature calculations.

2.Execute the main function of Me2.py, calculating CC recognition results, including Recall, Precision, FPR and F1-score. In addition, obtaining a random forest training model.

3.Execute the main function in Location.py to calculate the statement suspicion.

4.Execute the main function in FaultMe.py to get the metrics of fault localization.


**Run Fuzzy Weighted KNN approach experimental code**

1.Execute the main function of featureExtract.py, obtain the results of four feature calculations, replace the execution in the main function with execution_baseline.

2.Execute the main function of MyTest2.py, calculating CC recognition results, including Recall, Precision, FPR and F1-score.

3.Execute the main function in base_Location.py to calculate the statement suspicion.

4.Execute the main function in bsse_Fault.py to get the metrics of fault localization.
